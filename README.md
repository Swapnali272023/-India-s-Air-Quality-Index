**Analysing Air Quality Index using Machine Learning.**

**OBJECTIVES**
1.Finding the most polluted cities in recent years and analysing the levels of pollutants here. Understanding the impact of covid-19 induced lockdowns on Air Quality in some of the major cities
2.Analysing which cities underwent the most drastic improvement in Air Quality and cities showed a spike in AQI levels in spite of a stringent lockdown.
3.We do a time series analysis of the data and fit a SARIMA model with computed orders to forecast India AQI.
4.Finding the most populated content.

**Conclusion**
1.Vehicular pollution contents are more related to air quality index.
2.Delhi is the most polluted city in terms of vehicular pollution contents.
3.Ahmadabad is the most polluted city in terms of industrial pollution content.
4.After COVID19 pandemic there is gradual decrease in vehicular pollution contents, industrial pollution content.
5.Extra Gradient Boost classifier 100% accurately classify the target variable.
